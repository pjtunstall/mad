The craft.<br /><br />The bomb.<br /><br />For there is a zen to everything, anything the human mind can turn itself to:<br /><br />a zen of flower arranging, a zen of tea.<br /><br />Aye, and there is the zen of bombing.<br /><br />Certain names have become legend. Elemental spirits, gods of destruction. In later times, all gladiators would take on their mask.<br /><br />There were four.<br /><br />There will be only one . . . <br /><br />`;

But what does any of it mean?<br /><br />You were ready to be one of them, your heroes, the ones who went before. Ready to meet your Blasted God. Yet it's you whom that great spirit of disaster has bowed down to. You had no plan for this.<br /><br />'We who are about to die salute you'<br /><br />The words grow dim with time as you trudge on into the waste.<br /><br />'Aut non' The emperor's reply.<br /><br />'Or not'<br /><br />And now . . . Uncharted territory.<br /><br />`;

What else could it be, this fiery feeling, this ecstasy?<br /><br />'Nos morituri . . .'<br /><br />Gunpowder, your favorite perfume, hung thick on the winter air that day. You trod as in a dream, craft honed to perfection. Mind racing beyond body, your spirit could hardly contain itself. That should have been the clue.<br /><br />But victory was all you'd known. How could you have known?<br /><br />You moved as never till now, ten steps ahead of your rivals and saw the dozen meanings in every gesture, all the futures branching.<br /><br />All but one.<br /><br />'We who are about to die salute you'<br /><br />'Or not'. The emperor's reply rings hollow in your ears. That charred husk--it dawns on you--is your own. The spectators rise in silent tumult, but you are already far hence.<br /><br />You were a gladiator once.<br /><br />And now . . . Uncharted territory.<br /><br />`;
