# Bugs

- Seen once when 4 people played a few games over a mobile hotspot, on one of the games, one player was unable to plant a bomb. Pressing 'X' had no effect. Some lack of coordination in adding and removing event listeners?
- Seen once on the same occasion. After one game, all 4 players were stuck on the "game in progress" screen. They had to restart the server and have them connect to the new IP address.
- Possibly fixed now that I dealt with another disconnection-related error, but, just in case, here's a note of what happened: I once saw a bug where server and client logged that one of two players had disconnected, but they hadn't. Both players were still in the chat. Only one had the ready button visible. On pressing it, the countdown was triggered for both. Haven't manage to replicate it.
- A bug I saw once, but haven't managed to replicate after many attempts, possibly already fixed now that disconnections during countdown are handled better. But I'll leave the details here just in case. Server crashed when a player in Safari pressed CTR+SHIFT+R to view simplified page, without styles, during countdown. Apparently this led to them being undefined even though the normal disconnection logic had not gone ahead. It triggered that classic lightning-conductor-of-errors, `isDead(player)`: `return grid[player?.position?.y][player?.position?.x].type === "fire";` (accusing arrow points to 2nd instance of player in the line), "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'undefined')". Since then I've added some protections and logging in case of future issues.
